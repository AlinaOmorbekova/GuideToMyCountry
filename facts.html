    <h1>Some amazing facts about Kyrgyzstan, a landlocked nation in love with the number 40</h1>

        <div class="column">
            <h2>1. They’re mad about Manas – and long poems</h2>
            <p>The eponymous hero of the Epic of Manas, a poem of which the longest version extends to a truly epic 500,000 lines, is celebrated in many ways. There are statues of him, roads, a university, a planet (yep) and an airport named after him, and an opera about him. The poem is reputed to be 1,000 years old, but most experts believe it actually originated in the 18th century.

        <div class="column">
            <h2>2. It’s landlocked – but has a lovely lake</h2>
            <p>Kyrgyzstan is one of 45 landlocked countries, but does have the consolation of Issyk-Kul, the world’s second largest high-altitude lake (behind Titicaca in South America). It is 113 miles long, 37 miles wide and reaches a depth of 668 metres (2,192 feet). The lake was a popular holiday resort during the Soviet era.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="column">
            <h2>3. They love mare’s milk</h2>
            <p>Kumyz, fermented mare’s milk, is drunk with great gusto in the steppes of Kyrgyzstan. Horse meat is also traditionally popular.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="column">
            <h2>4. 40 is their favourite number</h2>
            <p>“Kyrgyz” is thought to be derived from the Turkic word for “forty” – a reference to the 40 clans of the great Manas. The country’s flag, a nod to this, features a 40-ray sun.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="column">
            <h2>5. It has three Unesco World Heritage sites</h2>
            <p>The Tien-Shan mountain range is one, the network of routes that made up the historic Silk Road is another, the third is Sulayman Mountain on the outskirts of Osh. It is "the most complete example of a sacred mountain anywhere in Central Asia,” according to Unesco, and has been worshipped for several millennia. Women who climb to the shrine at the top will, according to legend, give birth to healthy children.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="column">
            <h2>6. And a 3,000-year-old city</h2>
            <p>Osh, the country’s second largest city, is also one of the oldest in the region. Its vast and bustling market – still going strong – was a key trading point on the Silk Road, the overland route taken by caravans heading between Europe and Asia.</p>

        <div class="column">
            <h2>7. Gold is king</h2>
            <p>Gold accounts for a remarkable 43 per cent of Kyrgyzstan’s exports – second highest is “dried legumes”, which makes up 3.5 per cent. The Kumtor Gold Mine in the Tian Shan mountains, which opened in 1997, sits on one of the largest gold deposits in the world.</p>

        <div class="column">
            <h2>8. And the spectacular cathedral at Karakol</h2>
            <p>Kyrgyzstan’s fourth-largest city, also on Issyk Kul, is a real gem, housing the impressive Russian Orthodox Holy Trinity Cathedral, a mosque, a zoo and a clutch of museums. The Jeti-Ögüz Rocks, an eye-catching rock formation, lie just to the west. Karakol is twinned with Asheville, North Carolina, often rated among the best US cities in which to live.</p>
